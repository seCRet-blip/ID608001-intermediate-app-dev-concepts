\section*{Assessment Overview}
In this \textbf{individual} assessment, you will develop a \textbf{RESTful API} using \textbf{Node.js} \& deploy it to \textbf{Heroku}. The main purpose of this assessment is to demonstrate your ability to develop a \textbf{RESTful API} using various taught concepts. However, you will be required to independently research \& implement more complex concepts. In addition, marks will be allocated for code elegance, documentation \& \textbf{Git} usage.\\

Due to a nation-wide lockdown, your local pub is no longer able to run their weekly quiz night onsite. Your local pub owners know you are an IT student \& ask if you want create an online quiz night application for them. For the first step, the pub owners want a \textbf{RESTful API} that provides various functions for registering, logging in, participating in various quizzes \& keeping track of scores so that they can give away prizes at the end of each quiz night.

\section*{Learning Outcome}
At the successful completion of this course, learners will be able to:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Apply design patterns \& programming principles using software development best practices.
	\item Design \& implement full-stack applications using industry relevant programming languages.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Functionality - Learning Outcomes 1, 2, 3 (50\%)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{User:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You will have \textbf{three} types of users - \textbf{super admin}, \textbf{admin} \& \textbf{basic} user.
		\item Each user will have the following information: first name, last name, username, email address, profile picture, password, confirm password \& role. The users' profile picture will be from the following \textbf{API} - \href{https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api}{https://avatars.dicebear.com/docs/http-api}. Each profile picture should be, in most cases, different. I suggest using a random seed when setting the user's profile picture.
		\item Each user can login, logout, get their information \& update their information. A \textbf{super admin} user can get all users' information, update all \textbf{admin} \& \textbf{basic} users' information \& delete all \textbf{admin} \& \textbf{basic} users. An \textbf{admin} user can get all \textbf{admin} \& \textbf{basic} users' information \& update all \textbf{basic} users' information. A \textbf{basic} user can register.
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for registering a \textbf{basic} user, the following error checking must be implemented:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item First name has a minimum length of two characters, a maximum length of 50 characters \& alpha characters only.
			\item Last name has the same error checking as first name above.
			\item Username is unique, has a minimum length of five characters, maximum length of ten characters \& alphanumeric characters only, i.e., johndoe123.
			\item Email address is unique, contains the username above, an @ special character \& a second-level domain, i.e., johndoe123@email.com.
			\item Password has a minimum length of eight characters, maximum length of 16 characters \& contains one numeric character \& one special character.
			\item Confirm password is the same as the password above. \textbf{Note:} Confirm password will not be a field in the \textbf{User} table. Rather, it will be used to validate the user's password.
		\end{itemize}
		For each error check, a status code \& response message is returned, i.e., "First name must have a minimum length of two characters".
		\item When performing a \textbf{POST} request for logging in a user using either username/password or email address/password, return a status code, a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully logged in" \& the user's \textbf{JWT}.
		\item When performing a \textbf{GET} request for logging out a user, return a status code, a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully logged out" \& set the user's \textbf{JWT} to expired.
		\item When performing a \textbf{PUT} \& \textbf{DELETE} request, return a status code \& a response message, i.e., "$<$User's username$>$'s information has successfully updated" or "$<$User's username$>$ has successfully deleted".
		\item Two \textbf{super admin} users are seeded via you. Only you can seed the two \textbf{super admin} users. The \textbf{super admin} users' data will be fetched from a local file \& inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}. 
		\item Five \textbf{admin} users are seeded via a \textbf{super admin} user. Only a \textbf{super admin} user can seed the five \textbf{admin} users. The \textbf{admin} users' data will be fetched from a private \textbf{GitHub Gist} using \textbf{Axios} \& inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}.  
		\item Five \textbf{basic} users are seeded via a \textbf{super admin} or an \textbf{admin} user. Only a \textbf{super admin} or an \textbf{admin} user can seed the five \textbf{basic} users. The \textbf{basic} users' data will be fetched from a private \textbf{GitHub Gist} using \textbf{Axios} \& inserted into the \textbf{User} table using \textbf{Prisma}. 
	\end{itemize} 
	\item \textbf{Quiz:}
